Here, a Spirit AeroSystems logo is seen on a 737 fuselage sent to Boeing\\'s factory in Renton, Wash., in January.Jason Redmond/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption Joshua Dean, who died on Tuesday, had gone public with his concerns about defects and quality-control problems at Spirit AeroSystems, a major supplier of parts for Boeing. Here, a Spirit AeroSystems logo is seen on a 737 fuselage sent to Boeing\\'s factory in Renton, Wash., in January. Joshua Dean, a former quality auditor ata key Boeing supplierwho raised concerns aboutimproperly drilled holesin the fuselage of 737 Max jets, has died. Dean, 45, died on Tuesday morning, his family announced on social media. His family told NPR on Thursday that Dean had quickly fallen into critical condition after being diagnosed with aMRSA bacterial infection. He was airlifted from \\u200b\\u200ba hospital in Wichita, Kan., to another facility in Oklahoma City, but medical teams were unable to save his life,according toThe Seattle Times, which was the first to report his death. \"He passed away yesterday morning, and his absence will be deeply felt. We will always love you Josh,\" Dean\\'s aunt, Carol Dean Parsons, said via Facebook. Dean was one of the first to flag potentially dangerous defects with 737 Max jets at Spirit AeroSystems, a major Boeing supplier that was spun off from the planemaker in 2005. Now federal investigators are looking more closely at Spirit and Boeing to understand what went wrong with the door panel that blew off an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9in midair in January— the latest chapter in a long and troubled relationship between the two companies. \"Our thoughts are with Josh Dean\\'s family. This sudden loss is stunning news here and for his loved ones,\" said Spirit spokesman Joe Buccino in a statement. Dean is the second Boeing-related whistleblower to die in the past three months. In March,John Barnett, 62,died in Charleston, S.C., \"from what appears to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound,\" the local coroner said. At the time, Barnett had been testifying in his retaliation lawsuit against Boeing. Police in Charleston say they\\'re still investigating his death. Dean and Barnett were both represented by lawyer Brian Knowles. \"Josh\\'s passing is a loss to the aviation community and the flying public,\" Knowles said in a statement. \"He possessed tremendous courage to stand up for what he felt was true and right and raised quality and safety issues. Aviation companies should encourage and incentivize those that do raise these concerns.\" Dean\\'s mother and stepfather describe him as a studious and honest man, a \"health nut\" who rarely drank and attended church regularly. His career was helped by his prodigious memory and attention to detail, they said. \"He was just amazing,\" said Winn Weir, Dean\\'s stepfather. \"He could read something and then he could just tell you word for word what he read\" days later. Dean started feeling sick around two weeks ago, his mother, Virginia Green, told NPR. He stayed home from work for a couple days, but things got worse. \"Sunday[April 21] is when I got a call from him that he was really sick and having trouble breathing,\" Green said. \"Said he went to an immediate care and they told him he had strep throat.\" Green went to check on her son at his home, telling him to call her if he felt worse. \"He did call me a couple hours later, told me he was in the emergency room,\" she said. \"And he was scared. They found something on his lungs.\" \"He tested positive for influenza B, he tested positive for MRSA. He had pneumonia, his lungs were completely filled up. And from there, he just went downhill.\" Dean was initially treated at St. Joseph hospital in Wichita. But as he got worse, he was sent to an Integris hospital in Oklahoma City. It was a stunning turn of events for Dean and his family. Green says he was very healthy — someone who went to the gym, ran nearly every day and was very careful about his diet. \"This was his first time ever in a hospital,\" she said. \"He didn\\'t even have a doctor because he never was sick.\" But within days, Dean\\'s kidneys gave out and he was relying on anECMO life support machineto do the work of his heart and lungs. The night before Dean died, Green said, the medical staff in Oklahoma did a bronchoscopy on his lungs. \"The doctor said he\\'d never seen anything like it before in his life. His lungs were just totally ... gummed up, and like a mesh over them.\" Green says she has asked for an autopsy to determine exactly what killed her son. Results will likely take months, she said. \"We\\'re not sure what he died of,\" she said. \"We know that he had a bunch of viruses. But you know, we don\\'t know if somebody did something to him, or did he just get real sick.\" Dean followed his father and grandfather into the commercial aviation industry, holding a series of jobs in the same factory in Wichita where they had both worked before. After earning a degree in engineering, Dean took his first job at Spirit in 2019. He was let go amid mass layoffs during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 but returned to work for the company the next year as a quality auditor. Dean took that job seriously and grew increasingly frustrated with what he described as a \"a culture of not counting defects correctly\" at Spirit. During two interviews in January, Dean said thatSpirit pressured employees not to report defectsin order to get planes out of the factory faster. \"Now, I\\'m not saying they don\\'t want you to go out there and inspect a job. You know, they do,\" Dean told NPR. \"But if you make too much trouble, you will get the Josh treatment. You will get what happened to me.\" Dean was fired in April of last year — in retaliation, he said, for flagging improperly drilled holes in fuselages. \"I think they were sending out a message to anybody else,\" Dean said. \"If you are too loud, we will silence you.\" Dean described what he saw while working for Spirit in a deposition fora lawsuit filed by the company\\'s shareholders, who accuse the company of misleading investors by attempting to conceal \"excessive\" numbers of defects at the Kansas factory. He was not a plaintiff in the case. In theshareholder lawsuit, Dean said he flagged a significant defect — mis-drilled holes in the aft pressure bulkhead of 737 Max fuselages — months before he was fired. His deposition lays out a series of pivotal dates: October 2022:In his auditor role, Dean realizes Spirit workers mis-drilled holes on the 737 Max aft pressure bulkhead, representing a potential threat to maintaining cabin pressure during flight. The lawsuit accuses the company of concealing the problem. April 13, 2023:Boeing publicly reveals learning of a separate defect, related to the tail fin fittings on certain 737 Max aircraft. Spirit then confirms that defect. April 26, 2023:Spirit fires Dean, saying he failed to flag the tail fin issue. In his testimony, Dean said he told company officials that he might have missed the tail fin defect because he had just discovered the problem with bulkheads he inspected and was focused on that. August 23, 2023:Boeing announces it has found fastener holes in the aft pressure bulkhead on certain 737 Max airplanes that don\\'t match its specifications,resulting in \"snowmen,\"due to the multiple holes\\' elongated shape. It\\'s the problem Dean flagged 10 months earlier. On the same day, Spiritreleases a statementacknowledging the issue. The shareholder lawsuit accuses Spirit of concealing the bulkhead defect \"not only from investors, but also apparently from Boeing.\" A Spirit spokesman says the company strongly disagrees with the lawsuit\\'s allegations, and it\\'s fighting the case in court. Boeing is currently in talks to acquire Spirit as the planemaker\\'s leaders concede they may have outsourced too many parts of the manufacturing chain. \"Did it go too far? Yeah, probably did. Now it\\'s here and now, and now I\\'ve got to deal with it,\" Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said in an interview with CNBC earlier this year. Boeing agreed last month to advance $425 million to Spirit as it works to improve its manufacturing quality. In interviews with NPR, Joshua Dean predicted it would be difficult to replace the experienced workforce that Spirit lost during the COVID-19 pandemic. \"The mechanics aren\\'t as experienced. Neither are the inspectors,\" Dean said. \"We\\'ve just lost that.\" But even after going public with his concerns about Spirit\\'s quality control, Dean said there were reasons for optimism about the future. And he said that CEO Patrick Shanahan, who took over in late 2023, has a unique opportunity to change Spirit\\'s culture for the better. \"What you really want is, you want someone to be able to play the hero,\" Dean said, saying Shanahan had a chance to play \"the new sheriff in town.\" \"We need to make sure that there is no retaliation or intimidation,\" Dean said. \"This culture of you\\'re too loud, you\\'ll be moved or silenced — that\\'s got to go.\"'}\n"

Joshua Dean, a former quality auditor ata key Boeing supplierwho raised concerns aboutimproperly drilled holesin the fuselage of 737 Max jets, has died. Dean, 45, died on Tuesday morning, his family announced on social media. His family told NPR on Thursday that Dean had quickly fallen into critical condition after being diagnosed with aMRSA bacterial infection. He was airlifted from \\u200b\\u200ba hospital in Wichita, Kan., to another facility in Oklahoma City, but medical teams were unable to save his life,according toThe Seattle Times, which was the first to report his death. \"He passed away yesterday morning, and his absence will be deeply felt. We will always love you Josh,\" Dean\\'s aunt, Carol Dean Parsons, said via Facebook. Dean was one of the first to flag potentially dangerous defects with 737 Max jets at Spirit AeroSystems, a major Boeing supplier that was spun off from the planemaker in 2005. Now federal investigators are looking more closely at Spirit and Boeing to understand what went wrong with the door panel that blew off an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9in midair in January— the latest chapter in a long and troubled relationship between the two companies. \"Our thoughts are with Josh Dean\\'s family.

You may have heard of Shai Davidai, the Israeli professor at Columbia University who has launched a crusade against the school’s pro-Palestinianprotestors. He’srocketed to fameby callingstudents terrorists, comparing himselfto Jewish victims of Nazi Germany, and demandingthe National Guard forcibly break up the student encampments. After the NYPD stormed Columbia’s campus on Tuesday night, arrestinghundreds of students, he retweeteda messageblaming the events on “a circus of narcissists, egged on by irresponsible faculty.” (Indeed.) Davidai, like many of the loud pro-Israelvoices in the national debate, is casting blanket aspersions on students who are protesting for good reasons. Well over 30,000 Palestinians are dead, many of whom are children; the devastation is so complete thata fully accurate death toll is now impossible. There isno good moral or strategic justificationfor Israel’s scorched-earth approach, which currently risks strengthening the terrorist groupHamas’s strategic position in the long term. Given that billions of American dollars are underwriting this atrocity, it’s easy to see why college campuses are in uproar. But while themajority of studentsare genuinely motivated by justifiable outrage, a smaller faction have gone to a much darker place: going so far as endorsing Hamas’s murder of Israelis and calling for the violent destruction of Israel. All too often, they are tolerated by — or even members of — protest leadership. Students for Justice in Palestine, thebiggest national forcebehind the college protests, has described Hamas’s mass slaughter on October 7 as “a historic win for the Palestinian resistance.” Khymani James, one of the leaders of the Columbia protests, publiclyfantasized about murdering “Zionists.”University of Pennsylvania students chanted in support of Hamas’s military wing (“al-Qassam, make us proud, take another soldier down”). An organizer at UC-Berkeley distributed pamphlets explaining,in his words, how the Hamas attack “was an act of decolonization.” The reciprocal extremism on college campuses, egged on by irresponsible university administrators who have heightened tensions by calling in the cops, is a window into a reality everyone knows: The American conversation about Israel-Palestine isbroken. Anyone who even touches the issue knows it’s toxic. The conversation is dominated by extremists who aggressively police the slightest misstep and punish internal dissent, a longstanding dynamic supercharged in recent years by social media. Recently, a prominent person in American politics privately told me that they see engagement on the topic as a no-win proposition. About half of all young American Jewish adults havestopped talking to someone they know over the conflict. There are deep reasons why America’s Israel-Palestine discourse is so dysfunctional. They range from the pro-Israel movement’s embrace of Israeli extremists to the pro-Palestinian movement’s radical-chic culture to the uninspiring alternative on offer in official Washington. Put together, they create an environment where the loudest and most influential voices on each side are all too often the most aggressive and uncompromising ones. In such an environment, the most reasonable people on each side — the ones that recognize that neither Israelis or Palestinians are going anywhere, and that peace can only be found through negotiated compromise — are sidelined. They are getting very little help from some alleged supporters of a two-state solution in Washington, where an insipid and out-of-touch approach does its own work to discredit the center. Understanding these dynamics can help us grasp the dueling narratives around the campus protests. But more importantly, it can help us comprehend why the space for creating pro-peace coalitions seems to have shrunk — and what can be done to rebuild it. In the United States, the Israel-Palestine debate has gone through a long process of polarization and radicalization that has only gotten worse in recent years. I know the dynamics on the pro-Israel side firsthand: When I was in college in the late 2000s, I was the president of my university’s pro-Israel campus group. I abandoned the post shortly after I got into a public argument with one of my own members after he endorsedWest Banksettlement, an enterprise that I always thought wasboth morally wrong and politically suicidal. As Israel’s government moved more and more to the right, increasingly captured by the anti-Palestinian settler movement, the pro-Israel movement moved with them — leaving no place for people like me. Today, I spend much of my professional lifecriticizing Israel from the anti-occupation left. There are deep reasons why the pro-Israel movement is the way that it is. When I used to attend closed-door events for student activists held by AIPAC, the leading American pro-Israel lobby, they would tell us that they do not see second-guessing the Israeli government as part of the job description. Israel’s leaders determined what was in the country’s best interests; AIPAC and its activists worked merely to support that agenda onCapitol Hill. This “we don’t judge” policy, rooted in an uncompromising version of Zionism that grants little weight to Palestinian rights, has turned AIPAC and its allies into lobbyists for colonialism. In this, they have enthusiastically linked up with outrightright-wing extremists like Pastor John Hagee, the leader of Christians United for Israel. The pro-Israel movement, once comfortable with a two-state solution when Israel’s leadership supported it, is now doing everything in its power to back a government bent on destroying it. What wasonce called “liberal Zionism”— the view, held by a majority of American Jews, that Israel has a right to exist but no right to occupy Palestinian land — no longer has a place in the organized pro-Israel movement.AIPACand other mainstream pro-Israel groups treat the smaller liberal Zionist organizations, like J Street and Americans for Peace Now, as mortal enemies. The pro-Israel movement’s current job is mainstreaming Israeli extremism. And it has long been willing to threaten people’s careers and livelihoods — through tools likea public blacklistof pro-Palestinian scholars and students — in order to accomplish that end. The pro-Palestinian movement in the United States is far weaker than its pro-Israel twin. There is no Palestinian AIPAC capable of leading$100 million campaigns to unseat members of Congress. But as Americans’sympathy with Palestinians continues to grow, the movement is poised to wield greater influence down the line — making its own radicalization process a subject of real concern. In his bookThe Movement and the Middle East, historian Michael Fischbach argues that the 1960s-era radical left in the United States fractured over Israel-Palestine, and the events of that period determined  “where progressive Americans stand on these issues today.” During the Cold War, the most hardline factions took an uncompromising pro-Palestine stance, seeing armed Arab struggle against Israel as part of the global fight against Western imperialism. More moderate groups, by contrast, supported Israel in existential conflicts like the 1967 Six-Day War. With extreme left factions playing a disproportionate role in shaping pro-Palestine activism, a significant chunk of the movement took on a similarly radical cast. In this, they were aided by the censorious efforts of the pro-Israel extremists, who worked to turn “Palestine” into a dirty word in mainstream American political discourse. This meant that, for many years, young people passionate about the Palestinian cause were drawn toward far-left factions who called for Israel’s destruction, lionized Palestinian violence, and saw the two-state solution as a sellout compromise. “It became a far-left issue because it was so stigmatized,” says Hussein Ibish, a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. “You had to be on the far left … in order to fit being a champion of the Palestinians into your professional career path.” In the 2000s, Ibish helped found the American Task Force on Palestine (ATFP), a DC-based group that aimed to promote the Palestinian cause from a pro-peace standpoint. He recalls unremitting hostility from both the AIPAC-style pro-Israel groups and the existing far-left pro-Palestinian infrastructure. ATFP was chronically short of money, maxing out at three full-time policy staffers. It ultimately shuttered its doors in 2016. “We failed,” Ibish says, “because no one supported us.” Today, the Palestinian cause is far more mainstream than it once was — especially among young people and liberals. This is primarily the result of Israel’s rightward political drift: As Israel continues West Bank colonization and pulverizingGaza, the injustice of the status quo becomes increasingly hard to deny. Yet far-left maximalists still wield disproportionate influence in the pro-Palestine activist and intellectual communities. This is why prominent voices on the issue today — likethe US Campaign for Palestinian Rights,“dirtbag left” podcasters, thepresident of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, andacademics like Judith Butler— have been able to praise or sanitize Hamas’s actions on October 7 without meaningful pushback on their own side. The most radical voices on both sides are not representative of broader public opinion. Polling shows that Americans favor a two-state solutionby a roughly 20-point margin. About 30 percent supportIsraeli annexation of the West Bank; only5 percentbelieve that Hamas’s action on October 7 was acceptable. A sizable majority of American Jews areuncomfortable with actions of the Israeli state; only a small minority of American Muslimsendorse terrorism against Israelis. The radicalism you see in the news or on social media reflects neither the mass public nor the views of Americans from the most affected groups. Instead, it reflects the views of the extremely engaged. Their every utterance or action is magnified by their extreme allies and enemies alike, making it seem as if the worst and most marginal voices stand in for everyone else. Extreme activists polarizing public debates isnotanuncommonphenomenon: Look, for example, at the wayanti-abortion activistsorclimate change radicalspush well beyond what the average person in their coalition supports. Once people get locked into mutually hostile camps, the rank-and-file becomes more tolerant of any kind of extremism directed at their opponents — and less tolerant of any internal voices calling for compromise and mutual dialogue. The more radical one side appears, the more the other radicalizes in response. What’s happening on Israel-Palestine is an especially bitter version of this standardpolitical polarization doom loop. So what can be done? The obvious answer is to make space for pro-peace voices. And that starts, counterintuitively, by creating room for more challenges to whatappearslike a moderate Washington consensus — but in reality is a debate heavily tilted toward Israel. Both major American political parties have long been staunchly pro-Israel. The Republican version of this is rabid, increasingly aligned withNetanyahuand his far-right government. The Democratic version is pallid, mouthing empty support for two states and bromides about shared liberal values even asIsrael starves Palestinian children. The handful of dissenters, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) or Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), have been relentlessly attacked as anti-Israel or even antisemitic (thoughthere’s more room for them today than there has been in the past). When the establishment seems out of touch with reality, extremism tends to flourish. Republicansmay be fine with that, butDemocrats clearly are not. If they wish to defang campus radicals on their left flank, they need to create more space in the system for taking legitimate concerns with Israel’s behavior seriously. Cease unconditional support for the war in Gaza and start thinking more creatively about how topressure Israelinto taking upPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’s recently reiterated offer to negotiate. As horribly polarized as the Israel-Palestine debate seems, there actually is space for productive coalition-building that can contribute toward the cause of peace.

But more importantly, it can help us comprehend why the space for creating pro-peace coalitions seems to have shrunk — and what can be done to rebuild it. In the United States, the Israel-Palestine debate has gone through a long process of polarization and radicalization that has only gotten worse in recent years. I know the dynamics on the pro-Israel side firsthand: When I was in college in the late 2000s, I was the president of my university’s pro-Israel campus group. I abandoned the post shortly after I got into a public argument with one of my own members after he endorsedWest Banksettlement, an enterprise that I always thought wasboth morally wrong and politically suicidal. As Israel’s government moved more and more to the right, increasingly captured by the anti-Palestinian settler movement, the pro-Israel movement moved with them — leaving no place for people like me. Today, I spend much of my professional lifecriticizing Israel from the anti-occupation left. There are deep reasons why the pro-Israel movement is the way that it is. When I used to attend closed-door events for student activists held by AIPAC, the leading American pro-Israel lobby, they would tell us that they do not see second-guessing the Israeli government as part of the job description. Israel’s leaders determined what was in the country’s best interests; AIPAC and its activists worked merely to support that agenda onCapitol Hill. This “we don’t judge” policy, rooted in an uncompromising version of Zionism that grants little weight to Palestinian rights, has turned AIPAC and its allies into lobbyists for colonialism. In this, they have enthusiastically linked up with outrightright-wing extremists like Pastor John Hagee, the leader of Christians United for Israel. The pro-Israel movement, once comfortable with a two-state solution when Israel’s leadership supported it, is now doing everything in its power to back a government bent on destroying it. What wasonce called “liberal Zionism”— the view, held by a majority of American Jews, that Israel has a right to exist but no right to occupy Palestinian land — no longer has a place in the organized pro-Israel movement.AIPACand other mainstream pro-Israel groups treat the smaller liberal Zionist organizations, like J Street and Americans for Peace Now, as mortal enemies. The pro-Israel movement’s current job is mainstreaming Israeli extremism. And it has long been willing to threaten people’s careers and livelihoods — through tools likea public blacklistof pro-Palestinian scholars and students — in order to accomplish that end. The pro-Palestinian movement in the United States is far weaker than its pro-Israel twin. There is no Palestinian AIPAC capable of leading$100 million campaigns to unseat members of Congress. But as Americans’sympathy with Palestinians continues to grow, the movement is poised to wield greater influence down the line — making its own radicalization process a subject of real concern. In his bookThe Movement and the Middle East, historian Michael Fischbach argues that the 1960s-era radical left in the United States fractured over Israel-Palestine, and the events of that period determined  “where progressive Americans stand on these issues today.” During the Cold War, the most hardline factions took an uncompromising pro-Palestine stance, seeing armed Arab struggle against Israel as part of the global fight against Western imperialism. More moderate groups, by contrast, supported Israel in existential conflicts like the 1967 Six-Day War. With extreme left factions playing a disproportionate role in shaping pro-Palestine activism, a significant chunk of the movement took on a similarly radical cast. In this, they were aided by the censorious efforts of the pro-Israel extremists, who worked to turn “Palestine” into a dirty word in mainstream American political discourse. This meant that, for many years, young people passionate about the Palestinian cause were drawn toward far-left factions who called for Israel’s destruction, lionized Palestinian violence, and saw the two-state solution as a sellout compromise. “It became a far-left issue because it was so stigmatized,” says Hussein Ibish, a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. “You had to be on the far left … in order to fit being a champion of the Palestinians into your professional career path.” In the 2000s, Ibish helped found the American Task Force on Palestine (ATFP), a DC-based group that aimed to promote the Palestinian cause from a pro-peace standpoint. He recalls unremitting hostility from both the AIPAC-style pro-Israel groups and the existing far-left pro-Palestinian infrastructure. ATFP was chronically short of money, maxing out at three full-time policy staffers. It ultimately shuttered its doors in 2016. “We failed,” Ibish says, “because no one supported us.” Today, the Palestinian cause is far more mainstream than it once was — especially among young people and liberals. This is primarily the result of Israel’s rightward political drift: As Israel continues West Bank colonization and pulverizingGaza, the injustice of the status quo becomes increasingly hard to deny. Yet far-left maximalists still wield disproportionate influence in the pro-Palestine activist and intellectual communities. This is why prominent voices on the issue today — likethe US Campaign for Palestinian Rights,“dirtbag left” podcasters, thepresident of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, andacademics like Judith Butler— have been able to praise or sanitize Hamas’s actions on October 7 without meaningful pushback on their own side. The most radical voices on both sides are not representative of broader public opinion. Polling shows that Americans favor a two-state solutionby a roughly 20-point margin. About 30 percent supportIsraeli annexation of the West Bank; only5 percentbelieve that Hamas’s action on October 7 was acceptable. A sizable majority of American Jews areuncomfortable with actions of the Israeli state; only a small minority of American Muslimsendorse terrorism against Israelis. The radicalism you see in the news or on social media reflects neither the mass public nor the views of Americans from the most affected groups. Instead, it reflects the views of the extremely engaged. Their every utterance or action is magnified by their extreme allies and enemies alike, making it seem as if the worst and most marginal voices stand in for everyone else. Extreme activists polarizing public debates isnotanuncommonphenomenon: Look, for example, at the wayanti-abortion activistsorclimate change radicalspush well beyond what the average person in their coalition supports. Once people get locked into mutually hostile camps, the rank-and-file becomes more tolerant of any kind of extremism directed at their opponents — and less tolerant of any internal voices calling for compromise and mutual dialogue. The more radical one side appears, the more the other radicalizes in response. What’s happening on Israel-Palestine is an especially bitter version of this standardpolitical polarization doom loop. So what can be done? The obvious answer is to make space for pro-peace voices. And that starts, counterintuitively, by creating room for more challenges to whatappearslike a moderate Washington consensus — but in reality is a debate heavily tilted toward Israel. Both major American political parties have long been staunchly pro-Israel. The Republican version of this is rabid, increasingly aligned withNetanyahuand his far-right government. The Democratic version is pallid, mouthing empty support for two states and bromides about shared liberal values even asIsrael starves Palestinian children. The handful of dissenters, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) or Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), have been relentlessly attacked as anti-Israel or even antisemitic (thoughthere’s more room for them today than there has been in the past). When the establishment seems out of touch with reality, extremism tends to flourish. Republicansmay be fine with that, butDemocrats clearly are not. If they wish to defang campus radicals on their left flank, they need to create more space in the system for taking legitimate concerns with Israel’s behavior seriously. Cease unconditional support for the war in Gaza and start thinking more creatively about how topressure Israelinto taking upPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’s recently reiterated offer to negotiate. As horribly polarized as the Israel-Palestine debate seems, there actually is space for productive coalition-building that can contribute toward the cause of peace.

The upshot is, there may be less room for disappointment with a lowered bar, especially with a massive buyback announcement likely. “Expectations aren’t very high this quarter, but if we get a better outlook, coupled with some reasons for excitement over AI, we could see the valuation start to expand quite a bit,” said Matt Stucky, chief portfolio manager at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. “It might be tough to count on that, but Apple is a high-quality defensive stock, with a lot of shareholder returns and cash flow. The shareholder returns are the dominant reason to have a position.” Analysts expect Apple to add another $90 billion to its repurchase program, suggesting it will follow Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. among the big-tech names that have announced huge buybacks this year. Apple has already spent more than $650 billion buying back its own stock since 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The buybacks have been a way for Apple to support earnings. Revenue is expected to fall almost 5% this quarter, which would represent its weakest rate in more than a year, as well as Apple’s fifth quarter of the past six with negative growth. Overall tech revenue is expected to rise 8.6% this quarter, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. The growth trends largely reflect the Greater China region, which accounted for nearly 19% of Apple’s 2023 revenue. The company has seen weak China iPhone sales as it loses market share to Huawei Technologies Co. The stock is down 10% this year, compared with a gain of 3.9% for the Nasdaq 100 Index. Relative to the tech-heavy benchmark, Apple’s underperformance in the first quarter of 2024 was its sharpest in more than a decade. The stock rose 1.9% on Thursday. Analysts are largely cautious. The consensus for Apple’s full-year revenue has dropped 2.2% over the past quarter, while the view for its net earnings is down 0.8%. Fewer than 60% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, a ratio well below that of other megacap tech. Still, such headwinds could be priced into shares following the year-to-date drop.

Furthermore, other megacaps have multiples that are comparable or even lower despite their stronger growth trends. “It is harder to find an argument to buy Apple compared with the other megacaps,” said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust. “It can’t substantiate growth, it doesn’t have a killer AI strategy, and it isn’t even cheap.” The iPhone maker is among the last of the megacaps to report, and the group’s results have been mostly positive.

However, it is refocusing its Macs on AI, news that spurred the stock’s best day in nearly a year last month, and it has been in talks with both OpenAI and Alphabet about adding some AI features to the iPhone. More details are expected at an event in June. If the results feature any further details on its AI strategy, that could provide additional excitement. Otherwise, an aggressive capital-return strategy could remind investors what they like about Apple amid a backdrop marked by high inflation and uncertainty over Fed policy. “I’m a long-term Apple bull, and while I’m turning pessimistic about it in the near term, I’m trying to err on the side of optimism,” Morgan said. “Headwinds seem pretty priced in and it has a huge cash hoard, so repurchasing shares and increasing its dividend could reinvigorate interest. However, until it finds a way to really reignite growth, I think the stock could be stuck in the mud.” Tech Chart of the Day SK Hynix Inc. revealed that its capacity to make high-bandwidth memory chips is almost fully booked through next year, underscoring the intense demand for semiconductors essential to artificial intelligence development.

When the four-team CFP debuted following the 2014 season, it fielded 3% of the Football Bowl Subdivision. This year, that number balloons to 9%. More teams inevitably means more complications. Some of the biggest questions are purely logistical. Others will center on teaching viewers about the system. Following the biggest controversy of the CFP era, getting fans to understand the process is an existential task. A quick refresher on the new system: 12 teams will make the expanded CFP -- five conference champs and seven at-large teams. The four highest-ranked conference champions are guaranteed the top four seeds with byes, and the remaining eight teams are seeded in order. Seeds 5-8 will host seeds 9-12 in first-round games on campus, with the winners heading to quarterfinals against the top four seeds at New Year\\'s Six bowl sites. From there, it\\'s a tournament. \"The four first-round games are arguably the biggest change in FBS football probably since the BCS came to be,\" CFP executive director Bill Hancocksaid in April. \"Only four schools will host those games, but 40 or so have to plan to host, so there\\'s a lot of details there.\" Some pieces of the process remain the same. The CFP field will still be decided by a 13-member committee using the same criteria. Despite the vitriol directed at the board after undefeated Florida State was left out in favor of Alabama this past season, CFP polling claims a 79% approval rating for the board. With a brand new system and dramatically increased access, plenty of fans will be shocked when the actual machinations of the playoff debut this winter. Here are 10 things fans need to prepare for heading into the new system. Picture this: the College Football Playoff releases its final rankings. Georgia, Michigan, TCU and Ohio State easily round out the top four, just like they did during the 2022 season. The bracket appears on the broadcast and sitting in the third spot ... is No. 7 Clemson? Welcome to the new world of seeding. The CFP management committee recently went through a bracketing exercise during their annual meetings in Dallas and modeled the 2022 field as a placeholder. Immediately, the confusion became clear. The four teams that would have earned byes (assuming adjusted 2024 conference affiliations) were No. 1 Georgia, No. 2 Michigan, No. 7 Clemson and No. 8 Utah. No. 3 TCU moved to the No. 5 seed and No. 4 Ohio State to the No. 6 seed. No. 16 Tulane was the final auto-bid, nudging No. 12 Washington out of the field to capture the No. 12 seed. Hancock emphasized after the bracketing exercise: \"Ranking, seeding – keep those words in mind. Ranking and seeding.\" Unlike in college basketball, the presence of byes dependent on conference championships means the top four teams in the field could get weird. In 2021 (again, assuming 2024 conference affiliations), ACC champion Pittsburgh was No. 12 in the CFP Rankings. The Panthers would have jumped No. 3 Georgia to enter as the No. 4 seed. With every conference now featuring their top two teams in the title games, upsets could make the field look even weirder.-- Shehan Jeyarajah The CFP got off easy in its first nine years, but the biggest controversy erupted last season in Year 10. Florida State became the first undefeated Power Five champion in 20 years not to play for a national championship. Part of the reason the CFP expanded was to diffuse such issues. Who cares if the No. 13 team gets left out of a 12-team field? Except it may not be No. 13. It might be No. 7. That is one of the biggest issues with the current structure. The highest-ranked Group of Five champion is guaranteed a spot. That means a Group of Five team could get in over a deserving (and higher-ranked) team from a Power Four conference. Had the 12-team bracket been in place last year, No. 23 Liberty, 13-0 but without a win vs. a ranked team, would have been the Group of Five rep. Consequently, No. 12 Oklahoma (10-2) would have been left out, as would No. 13 LSU (9-3) and No. 14 Arizona (9-3). The first time this happens -- and it will happen -- there will be an outcry. Oh, and if there is no ranked Group of Five champion -- that almost happened last season -- the selection committee decides (in secret) who that team will be. Get your questions ready for the selection committee chair.-- Dennis Dodd Teams safely in the field resting their players is unavoidable and likely. So are opt-outs from players with big-time NFL futures.We already told you. No, not in Ohio State-Michigan, but think of the conference championship game in which both teams are basically playing for seeding. It won\\'t be blatant, but think of the injured quarterback who starts the week as questionable. Are you going to risk a playoff run to win a conference championship? In the playoff, are you going to risk a lucrative NFL future if you\\'re, say, Bryce Young or Caleb Williams? If you can\\'t answer that question immediately, you\\'ve made my point for me. If collective bargaining emerges -- and it will, eventually -- expect language to be written into the deal guaranteeing players must play in games if healthy. \"I think we send a bad message to young men [who opt out],\" said Arkansas AD Hunter Yurachek, a member of the CFP selection committee. \"You\\'re turning your back on your teammates. You\\'re turning your back on your schools ... As these NIL deals come to fruition, there ought to be some type of incentive [in contracts] for you to play in those games.\"-- Dodd First-round games will be on campus beginning this year on Dec. 20-21. All good, except some campuses weren\\'t made to host football games in late December because of the whole darn academic thing. Schools like Penn State are already dealing with possible conflicts. There will be three CFP games played on Saturday, Dec. 21. Penn State\\'s fall commencement is the next day. If you\\'ve ever been to State College, Pennsylvania, you know hotel rooms are a premium. And it\\'s not like there are enough nearby hotels in neighboring towns to handle the overflow. You were warned here first. If Penn State is hosting a first-round game, the contest might be in Pittsburgh or Philadelphia. Not exactly Beaver Stadium, especially if it\\'s a rematch against the Big Ten team. Utah women\\'s basketball\\'shorrifying experienceduring the NCAA Tournament was the perfect example of the potential costs of the logistics quandary. With multiple events planned in Spokane, Washington, the Utes were forced to stay in Coeur d\\'Alene, Idaho, for the Gonzaga regional. Players and personnel said they were repeatedly bombarded with slurs while staying in the town. \"For our players and staff to not feel safe in an NCAA Tournament environment, it\\'s messed up,\" Utah women\\'s basketball coach Lynne Roberts said after the incidents.-- Dodd The CFP technically had two years remaining on its initial contract when it decided to expand. The early expansion could ultimately have some odd consequences, but none will stick out more than grandfathering in the existing bowl contracts. In the past, semifinal matchups were decided by team geographical preference. With all of the New Year\\'s Six bowls folded into the CFP, the selection committee must take into account existing bowl contracts with conferences. Most of the time, this won\\'t lead to much consequence. The SEC champ would almost always choose the Sugar Bowl as is, while the Big Ten champ will rarely say no to a Rose Bowl berth. Expansion does throw a wrench in it, though. For example: in 2025, the Cotton Bowl, Orange Bowl and Sugar Bowl are all quarterfinal games. If, for example, SMU was to make the field, the Mustangs might prefer staying in town for the Cotton Bowl. Because of their bowl contract with the ACC, SMU will automatically prioritize the Orange Bowl instead – thebowl gamefarthestaway. Starting in 2026, there are no contracts tying leagues or teams to bowl games. Only at that point, the CFP gets to start from scratch.-- Jeyarajah The Group of Five\\'s CFP pool has been watered down by realignment. The likes of Cincinnati, UCF and SMU have moved into Power Four conferences over the last couple of years. While the Group of Five champion is guaranteed a spot, the quality of that champion has gone down. (See: Liberty, above). ESPN saw that possibility when it bid on the expanded playoff. You better believe that impacted the worth of the playoff ($1.3 billion annually) that industry experts said was just OK. With the Mountain West now clearly the best Group of Five league, we may see Boise State finally get its championship shot. (The Broncos played all those BCS bowl games with no shot at a national title.) But if certain Conference USA teams get hot, we\\'re talking about Kennesaw State or Sam Houston in the CFP.-- Dodd One giant elephant remains in the room of the CFP ... the NFL. An antitrust exemption allows the league to start playing Saturday games in late December, which means that some of the quarterfinal games could directly go up against late-season NFL matchups. The NFL reportedly isn\\'t happy with the encroachment, but don\\'t expect any changes. Sources around the CFP were clear that rescheduling games, or trying to move them around the NFL, wasn\\'t realistic. Thursday and Friday games were among the options considered, but television partners were not interested. The CFP is scheduled to play three games – likely 12 p.m., 3:30 p.m. and 7 p.m. Eastern – on Dec. 21, 2024, and Dec. 20, 2025, both Saturdays. Without question, games going up against the NFL will suffer, but that\\'s simply reality. College football can\\'t afford to kowtow to every single NFL request. That said, don\\'t be surprised if some first-round games post relatively miserable ratings. It might not reflect low interest, just the ratings beast they\\'re fighting.-- Jeyarajah This is an early reminder that if Notre Dame is ranked No. 1, it still has to play four games, including a first-rounder, to have a shot at a national championship. Former athletic director Jack Swarbrick decided that even if the Fighting Irish finish in the top four -- an automatic bye for everyone else -- they will play that extra game and be seeded most likely no better than No. 5. The rationale is that since Notre Dame doesn\\'t play a league championship game, it will get an extra week off to prepare. Yes, but I can hear the mewling now from South Bend when the Irish go 12-0 or 11-1 and still have to play four to win it all. Notably, Swarbrick served on the working group with former Big 12 commish Bob Bowlsby and SEC commissioner Greg Sankey that generated the 12-team playoff format.-- Dodd College football has historically hated rematches. The 2011 BCS Championship Game between Alabama and LSU was a major driver of delivering the CFP. One of the biggest cases against divisionless conferences is the likelihood of a rematch between powers in conference title games. Well, the future is here. Rematches are a relative certainty now. In the CFP\\'s bracketing exercise, a rematch showed up in the first round as No. 6 seed Ohio State would have played No. 11 seed Penn State in 2022. The 2023 field would have featured two, with No. 6 seed Georgia facing No. 11 seed Ole Miss and No. 7 seed Ohio State playing No. 10 seed Penn State. The Game between Ohio State and Michigan could conceivably be played three times: in the regular season, Big Ten Championship Game and CFP. College basketball\\'s NCAA Tournamen has tried to get ahead of this issue with rules attempting to minimize the number of conference teams in a region. That\\'s easier to do with 68 teams in a field from 32 conferences. With 12 teams from primarily four conferences, the logistics prove far more difficult. Ultimately, conference commissioners are willing to deal with the weirdness.-- Jeyarajah The ESPN broadcast on Selection Sunday often jokes that the graphics operator is the most powerful man in college football for a few minutes; he is the only one who knows the full reveal. With the field growing to 12 and a wildly more complicated system now in place, the graphical minds of the CFP become the stars of the show. ESPN has historically released a top six on Selection Sunday -- the four CFP teams and first two out. The CFP chair, which will be Michigan athletic director Warde Manuel in 2024, then goes out for an interview, and the full rankings are not released until later. With a 12-team CFP field and a Group of Five team that is likely to be outside of the top 12, releasing a small snippet might not cut it anymore. Additionally, the broadcast has some flexibility to release teams in order for dramatic effect. In this field, the top four are the most predictable. Would the CFP prefer the bracket to be released in a different order? Will ESPN release the full rankings and then move over for seedings? How they handle the reveal could determine whether fans ultimately understand how the field works. Sources told CBS Sports that the CFP and ESPN are still mulling options on how to present the final bracket. Some of the delay for releasing the whole field historically also centers around contacting New Year\\'s Six bowls to let them know the logistics. All of that will have to move much faster when 12 teams are on the hook.-- Jeyarajah'}\n",

It might not reflect low interest, just the ratings beast they\\'re fighting.-- Jeyarajah This is an early reminder that if Notre Dame is ranked No. 1, it still has to play four games, including a first-rounder, to have a shot at a national championship. Former athletic director Jack Swarbrick decided that even if the Fighting Irish finish in the top four -- an automatic bye for everyone else -- they will play that extra game and be seeded most likely no better than No. 5. The rationale is that since Notre Dame doesn\\'t play a league championship game, it will get an extra week off to prepare. Yes, but I can hear the mewling now from South Bend when the Irish go 12-0 or 11-1 and still have to play four to win it all. Notably, Swarbrick served on the working group with former Big 12 commish Bob Bowlsby and SEC commissioner Greg Sankey that generated the 12-team playoff format.-- Dodd College football has historically hated rematches. The 2011 BCS Championship Game between Alabama and LSU was a major driver of delivering the CFP. One of the biggest cases against divisionless conferences is the likelihood of a rematch between powers in conference title games. Well, the future is here. Rematches are a relative certainty now. In the CFP\\'s bracketing exercise, a rematch showed up in the first round as No. 6 seed Ohio State would have played No. 11 seed Penn State in 2022. The 2023 field would have featured two, with No. 6 seed Georgia facing No. 11 seed Ole Miss and No. 7 seed Ohio State playing No. 10 seed Penn State. The Game between Ohio State and Michigan could conceivably be played three times: in the regular season, Big Ten Championship Game and CFP. College basketball\\'s NCAA Tournamen has tried to get ahead of this issue with rules attempting to minimize the number of conference teams in a region. That\\'s easier to do with 68 teams in a field from 32 conferences. With 12 teams from primarily four conferences, the logistics prove far more difficult. Ultimately, conference commissioners are willing to deal with the weirdness.-- Jeyarajah The ESPN broadcast on Selection Sunday often jokes that the graphics operator is the most powerful man in college football for a few minutes; he is the only one who knows the full reveal. With the field growing to 12 and a wildly more complicated system now in place, the graphical minds of the CFP become the stars of the show. ESPN has historically released a top six on Selection Sunday -- the four CFP teams and first two out. The CFP chair, which will be Michigan athletic director Warde Manuel in 2024, then goes out for an interview, and the full rankings are not released until later. With a 12-team CFP field and a Group of Five team that is likely to be outside of the top 12, releasing a small snippet might not cut it anymore. Additionally, the broadcast has some flexibility to release teams in order for dramatic effect. In this field, the top four are the most predictable. Would the CFP prefer the bracket to be released in a different order? Will ESPN release the full rankings and then move over for seedings? How they handle the reveal could determine whether fans ultimately understand how the field works. Sources told CBS Sports that the CFP and ESPN are still mulling options on how to present the final bracket. Some of the delay for releasing the whole field historically also centers around contacting New Year\\'s Six bowls to let them know the logistics. All of that will have to move much faster when 12 teams are on the hook.-- Jeyarajah'}\n",

With his raucous rhythms, and backing hollers and hand claps, Eddy sold more than 100 million records worldwide, and mastered a distinctive sound based on the premise that a guitar’s bass strings sounded better on tape than the high ones. “I had a distinctive sound that people could recognize and I stuck pretty much with that. I’m not one of the best technical players by any means; I just sell the best,” he told The Associated Press in a 1986 interview. “A lot of guys are more skillful than I am with the guitar. A lot of it is over my head. But some of it is not what I want to hear out of the guitar.” “Twang” defined Eddy’s sound from his first album, “Have Twangy Guitar Will Travel,” to his 1993 box set, “Twang Thang: The Duane Eddy Anthology.” “It’s a silly name for a nonsilly thing,” Eddy told the AP in 1993. “But it has haunted me for 35 years now, so it’s almost like sentimental value — if nothing else.” He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994. Eddy and producer Lee Hazlewood helped create the “Twang” sound in the 1950s, a sound Hazlewood later adapt to his production of Nancy Sinatra’s 1960s smash “These Boots Are Made for Walkin.’” Eddy had a five-year commercial peak from 1958-63. He said in 1993 he took his 1970 hit “Freight Train” as a clue to slow down. “It was an easy listening hit,” he recalled. “Six or seven years before, I was on the cutting edge.” Eddy recorded more than 50 albums, some of them reissues.

Eddy later toured with Dick Clark’s “Caravan of Stars” and appeared in “Because They’re Young,” “Thunder of Drums” among other movies. He moved to Nashville in 1985 after years of semiretirement in Lake Tahoe, California. Eddy was not a vocalist, saying in 1986, “One of my biggest contributions to the music business is not singing.” Paul McCartney and George Harrison were both fans of Eddy and he recorded with both of them after their Beatles’ days.

The investigation\\xa0was completed in November, but CENTCOM did not publicly disclose its findings until Thursday. The probe “concluded the strike was conducted in compliance with the law of armed conflict as well as Department of Defense and CENTCOM policies” but “revealed several issues that could be improved,” according to a summary of the findings obtained by CNN. The summary declined to detail the “issues,” saying that many of the facts of the investigation remain classified. “We are committed to learning from this incident and improving our targeting processes to mitigate potential civilian harm,” the summary says. Questions about who was actually killed in the May 3, 2023, airstrike were raised almost immediately, with the man’s family insisting he was not an al Qaeda leader but a farmer and father of 10 named\\xa0Loutfi Hassan Mesto.\\xa0Still, the US did not launch an official investigation of the strike until nearly 8 weeks later after the strike that killed him. Asked about the nearly six month delay to making the conclusions public, a defense official pointed to the need to coordinate with multiple organizations, including the Syrian White Helmets, a non-governmental emergency response organization. “Multiple extensions were requested in order to ensure this investigation was thorough, accurate, and included all relevant information,” the official said. The investigation was ultimately ordered by General Erik Kurilla, the senior general in charge of US forces in the Middle East. Kurilla ordered that his commandannounce on Twitterthat a senior al Qaeda leader had been targeted in the May 2023 drone strike, despite not yet having confirmation of who was actually killed in the strike, CNN previously reported. Mesto’s family was not offered a compensation payment, known as an\\xa0ex gratia\\xa0payment, following his killing, the defense official told CNN. A compensation payment was considered, but “determined not appropriate,” the official said. “The family will not be receiving monetary compensation given the facts of this situation and both policy and practical limitations.” It is unclear what about the deadly drone strike led the military to conclude an ex gratia payment was not appropriate in this case. The incident raised questions about how thoroughly CENTCOM had implemented the military’s civilian harm mitigation policy, a process for preventing and responding to civilian casualties as a result of US military operations. The policy was developed in 2022 after abotched US drone strike in Kabulthat killed 10 civilians in the final days of the withdrawal from Afghanistan. In that case, CENTCOM opened a formal 15-6 investigation into the strike within a week of the operation.\\xa0Family members of the victims were offered ex gratia payments. The investigation of Mesto’s death, which concluded on November 15, 2023, was carried out by senior service members and civilian employees “not directly involved with the strike,\\xa0with extensive subject matter expertise in intelligence, law of armed conflict, operations, and targeting matters,” the CENTCOM summary says. The team, led by Brigadier General John P. Cogbill, interviewed more than 40 witnesses, visited sites in Iraq, Jordan and the US, and solicited information from non-governmental organizations.
